# idea
- local one-screen multiplayer top-down fighter
- multiple mutant spiders fight with each other
- each round they begin with buying their limbs. each limb has a special ability
  - legs give you more speed (if you have no legs, you don't move)
  - arms are weapons (like chainsaw, gun, or just fist)
  - heads (might be hp)
- if you lose your hp, you go to the next round.
