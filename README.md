# idea
- local one-screen multiplayer top-down fighter
- multiple mutant spiders fight with each other
- each round they begin with buying their limbs. each limb has a special ability
  - legs give you more speed (if you have no legs, you don't move)
  - arms are weapons (like chainsaw, gun, or just fist)
- if you lose your hp, you go to the next round.
- hp is separate from the limbs, it is currency to use to buy limbs (could be multiple round where you gain some hp after each round)
- the winner gains less hp back than the loser, who gets fully healed, but loses most limbs
